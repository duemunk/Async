Syntactic sugar in Swift for asynchronous dispatches in Grand Central Dispatch ([GCD](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html))

**Async** sugar looks like this:

```swift
Async.background {
	print("This is run on the background queue")
}.main {
	print("This is run on the main queue, after the previous block")
}
```

Instead of the familiar syntax for GCD:

```swift
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND, 0), {
	print("This is run on the background queue")

	dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
		print("This is run on the main queue, after the previous block")
	})
})
```

**AsyncGroup** sugar looks like this:

```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.background {
    print("This is run on the background queue")
}
group.background {
    print("This is also run on the background queue in parallel")
}
group.notifyOnMainQueue {
	print("Both asynchronous blocks are complete")
}
```

### Install
#### CocoaPods
```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod "AsyncSwift"
```
#### Carthage
```ruby
github "duemunk/Async"
```

### Benefits
1. Less verbose code
2. Less code indentation

### Things you can do
Supports the modern queue classes:

```swift
Async.main {}
Async.userInteractive {}
Async.userInitiated {}
Async.utility {}
Async.background {}
```

Chain as many blocks as you want:

```swift
Async.userInitiated {
	// 1
}.main {
	// 2
}.background {
	// 3
}.main {
	// 4
}
```

Store reference for later chaining:

```swift
let backgroundBlock = Async.background {
	print("This is run on the background queue")
}

// Run other code here...

// Chain to reference
backgroundBlock.main {
	print("This is run on the \(qos_class_self().description) (expected \(qos_class_main().description)), after the previous block")
}
```

Custom queues:

```swift
let customQueue = dispatch_queue_create("CustomQueueLabel", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
let otherCustomQueue = dispatch_queue_create("OtherCustomQueueLabel", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
Async.customQueue(customQueue) {
	print("Custom queue")
}.customQueue(otherCustomQueue) {
	print("Other custom queue")
}
```

Dispatch block after delay:

```swift
let seconds = 0.5
Async.main(after: seconds) {
	print("Is called after 0.5 seconds")
}.background(after: 0.4) {
	print("At least 0.4 seconds after previous block, and 0.9 after Async code is called")
}
```

Cancel blocks that aren't already dispatched:

```swift
// Cancel blocks not yet dispatched
let block1 = Async.background {
	// Heavy work
	for i in 0...1000 {
		print("A \(i)")
	}
}
let block2 = block1.background {
	print("B – shouldn't be reached, since cancelled")
}
Async.main {
	// Cancel async to allow block1 to begin
	block1.cancel() // First block is _not_ cancelled
	block2.cancel() // Second block _is_ cancelled
}
```

Wait for block to finish – an ease way to continue on current queue after background task:
```swift
let block = Async.background {
	// Do stuff
}

// Do other stuff

block.wait()
```

### How does it work
The way it work is by using the new notification API for GCD introduced in OS X 10.10 and iOS 8. Each chaining block is called when the previous queue has finished.

```swift
let previousBlock = {}
let chainingBlock = {}
let dispatchQueueForChainingBlock = ...

// Use the GCD API to extend the blocks
let _previousBlock = dispatch_block_create(DISPATCH_BLOCK_INHERIT_QOS_CLASS, previousBlock)
let _chainingBlock = dispatch_block_create(DISPATCH_BLOCK_INHERIT_QOS_CLASS, chainingBlock)

// Use the GCD API to call back when finishing the "previous" block
dispatch_block_notify(_previousBlock, dispatchQueueForChainingBlock, _chainingBlock)
```

The syntax part of the chaining works by having class methods on the `Async` object e.g. `Async.main {}` which returns a struct. The struct has matching methods e.g. `theStruct.main {}`.

### Known bugs
Modern GCD queues don't work as expected in the iOS Simulator. See issues [13](https://github.com/duemunk/Async/issues/13), [22](https://github.com/duemunk/Async/issues/22).

### Known improvements
The ```dispatch_block_t``` can't be extended. Workaround used: Wrap ```dispatch_block_t``` in a struct that takes the block as a property.

### Apply
There is also a wrapper for [`dispatch_apply()`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/c/func/dispatch_apply)  for quick parallelisation of a `for` loop.

```swift
Apply.background(100) { i in
	// Do stuff e.g. print(i)
}
```
Note that this function returns after the block has been run all 100 times i.e. it is not asynchronous. For asynchronous behaviour, wrap it in a an `Async` block like `Async.background { Apply.background(100) { ... } }`.

### AsyncGroup
**AsyncGroup** facilitates working with groups of asynchronous blocks.

Multiple dispatch blocks with GCD:

```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.background {
    // Run on background queue
}
group.utility {
    // Run on utility queue, in parallel to the previous block
}
```
All modern queue classes:

```swift
group.main {}
group.userInteractive {}
group.userInitiated {}
group.utility {}
group.background {}
```
Custom queues:

```swift
let customQueue = dispatch_queue_create("Label", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
group.customQueue(customQueue) {}
```

Wait for group to finish:

```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.background {
    // Do stuff
}
group.background {
    // Do other stuff in parallel
}
// Wait for both to finish
group.wait()
// Do rest of stuff
```
Non-blocking alternative for group to finish:

```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.background {
    // Do stuff
}
group.background {
    // Do other stuff in parallel
}
group.notifyOnMainQueue {
	print("Both asynchronous blocks are complete on main queue")
}
```

All modern queue classes:

```swift
group.notifyOnMainQueue {}
group.notifyOnUserInteractiveQueue {}
group.notifyOnUserInitiatedQueue {}
group.notifyOnUtilityQueue {}
group.notifyOnBackgroundQueue {}
```

Custom queues:

```swift
let customQueue = dispatch_queue_create("customQueue", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
group.notifyOnQueue(customQueue) {
 	print("Both asynchronous blocks are complete on custom queue")
}
```
Custom asynchronous operations:

```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.enter()
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0)) {
    // Do stuff
    group.leave()
}
group.enter()
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0)) {
    // Do other stuff in parallel
    group.leave()
}
// Wait for both to finish
// You also can use the Non-blocking alternative
group.wait()
// Do rest of stuff
```
