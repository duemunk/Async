Now more than syntactic sugar for asynchronous dispatches in Grand Central Dispatch ([GCD](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html)) in Swift

**Async** sugar looks like this:
```swift
Async.userInitiated {
	return 10
}.background {
	return "Score: \($0)"
}.main {
	label.text = $0
}
```

So even though GCD has nice-ish syntax as of Swift 3.0, compare the above with:
```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
	let value = 10
	DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
		let text = "Score: \(value)"
		DispatchQueue.main.async {
			label.text = text
		}
	}
}
```

**AsyncGroup** sugar looks like this:
```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.background {
    print("This is run on the background queue")
}
group.background {
    print("This is also run on the background queue in parallel")
}
group.wait()
print("Both asynchronous blocks are complete")
```

### Install
#### CocoaPods
```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod "AsyncSwift"
```
#### Carthage
```ruby
github "duemunk/Async"
```

### Benefits
1. Avoid code indentation by chaining
2. Arguments and return types reduce polluted scopes

### Things you can do
Supports the modern queue classes:
```swift
Async.main {}
Async.userInteractive {}
Async.userInitiated {}
Async.utility {}
Async.background {}
```

Chain as many blocks as you want:
```swift
Async.userInitiated {
	// 1
}.main {
	// 2
}.background {
	// 3
}.main {
	// 4
}
```

Store reference for later chaining:
```swift
let backgroundBlock = Async.background {
	print("This is run on the background queue")
}

// Run other code here...

// Chain to reference
backgroundBlock.main {
	print("This is run on the \(qos_class_self().description) (expected \(qos_class_main().description)), after the previous block")
}
```

Custom queues:
```swift
let customQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "CustomQueueLabel", attributes: [.concurrent])
let otherCustomQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "OtherCustomQueueLabel")
Async.custom(queue: customQueue) {
	print("Custom queue")
}.custom(queue: otherCustomQueue) {
	print("Other custom queue")
}
```

Dispatch block after delay:
```swift
let seconds = 0.5
Async.main(after: seconds) {
	print("Is called after 0.5 seconds")
}.background(after: 0.4) {
	print("At least 0.4 seconds after previous block, and 0.9 after Async code is called")
}
```

Cancel blocks that aren't already dispatched:
```swift
// Cancel blocks not yet dispatched
let block1 = Async.background {
	// Heavy work
	for i in 0...1000 {
		print("A \(i)")
	}
}
let block2 = block1.background {
	print("B – shouldn't be reached, since cancelled")
}
Async.main {
	// Cancel async to allow block1 to begin
	block1.cancel() // First block is _not_ cancelled
	block2.cancel() // Second block _is_ cancelled
}
```

Wait for block to finish – an ease way to continue on current queue after background task:
```swift
let block = Async.background {
	// Do stuff
}

// Do other stuff

block.wait()
```

### How does it work
The way it work is by using the new notification API for GCD introduced in OS X 10.10 and iOS 8. Each chaining block is called when the previous queue has finished.
```swift
let previousBlock = {}
let chainingBlock = {}
let dispatchQueueForChainingBlock = ...

// Use the GCD API to extend the blocks
let _previousBlock = dispatch_block_create(DISPATCH_BLOCK_INHERIT_QOS_CLASS, previousBlock)
let _chainingBlock = dispatch_block_create(DISPATCH_BLOCK_INHERIT_QOS_CLASS, chainingBlock)

// Use the GCD API to call back when finishing the "previous" block
dispatch_block_notify(_previousBlock, dispatchQueueForChainingBlock, _chainingBlock)
```

The syntax part of the chaining works by having class methods on the `Async` object e.g. `Async.main {}` which returns a struct. The struct has matching methods e.g. `theStruct.main {}`.

### Known bugs
Modern GCD queues don't work as expected in the iOS Simulator. See issues [13](https://github.com/duemunk/Async/issues/13), [22](https://github.com/duemunk/Async/issues/22).

### Known improvements
The ```dispatch_block_t``` can't be extended. Workaround used: Wrap ```dispatch_block_t``` in a struct that takes the block as a property.

### Apply
There is also a wrapper for [`dispatch_apply()`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/c/func/dispatch_apply)  for quick parallelisation of a `for` loop.
```swift
Apply.background(100) { i in
	// Do stuff e.g. print(i)
}
```
Note that this function returns after the block has been run all 100 times i.e. it is not asynchronous. For asynchronous behaviour, wrap it in a an `Async` block like `Async.background { Apply.background(100) { ... } }`.

### AsyncGroup
**AsyncGroup** facilitates working with groups of asynchronous blocks.

Multiple dispatch blocks with GCD:
```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.background {
    // Run on background queue
}
group.utility {
    // Run on utility queue, in parallel to the previous block
}
group.wait()
```
All modern queue classes:
```swift
group.main {}
group.userInteractive {}
group.userInitiated {}
group.utility {}
group.background {}
```
Custom queues:
```swift
let customQueue = dispatch_queue_create("Label", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
group.custom(queue: customQueue) {}
```
Wait for group to finish:
```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.background {
    // Do stuff
}
group.background {
    // Do other stuff in parallel
}
// Wait for both to finish
group.wait()
// Do rest of stuff
```
Custom asynchronous operations:
```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
group.enter()
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0)) {
    // Do stuff
    group.leave()
}
group.enter()
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0)) {
    // Do other stuff in parallel
    group.leave()
}
// Wait for both to finish
group.wait()
// Do rest of stuff
```
You can also execute a block once all of the other tasks are complete without blocking the calling thread:
```swift
let group = AsyncGroup()
for item in items {
    group.enter()
    someAsyncCallWithCallback {
        response in
        // Handle response
        group.leave()
    }
}
// Now that the above is complete, let's perform this block on the main queue
group.notifyMain {
    // Do something else now that the previous is done
}
```
