Chainable dispatch blocks with GCD:

All moderns queue classes:

Custom queues:

    let customQueue = dispatch_queue_create("Label", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
    Async.customQueue(customQueue) {}

Dispatch block after delay:

    let seconds = 0.5
    Async.main(after: seconds) {}

Cancel blocks not yet dispatched
